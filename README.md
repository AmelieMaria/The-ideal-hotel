# The-ideal-hotel

Nowadays holiday apartments are a common choice for tourists to book while being on holidays. For the hotels that means that they need to compete with a new big sector. In Lisbon, the amount of holiday apartments is 3 times higher then the amount of hotels. 
One factor for hotels to compete is inserting the hotel on holiday apartment channels, such as Airbnb. But we need to take into condiseration that when a tourist goes to Airbnb, for instance, the goal usually is to find a holiday apartment and not a hotel.
